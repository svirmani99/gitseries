GitHub is a remote repository present on the web which lets you store your files on the web. It gives an opportunity to contribute in any projects worldwide. We can interact with GitHub using a command-line interface tool called Git.

Why GitHub is so popular and used in most of the projects?
GitHub is the world's largest software development platform. It provides cloud storage for source code and supports all popular programming languages. Navigating through source files is always very fast.  It also provides access control and several collaboration features, like basic task management tools for every project.

TASK 2

How git workflow works?
The git workflow has 4 parts: Workspace, Index, Local repository and Remote repository.
Workspace: A workspace is simply a set of git repositories.
Index: The Git index is used as a staging area between your working directory and your repository. 
Local Repository: A Git local repository is the one on which we will make local changes, typically this local repository is on our computer.
Remote Repository: A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. 

What are the different stages of git project?
Different stages of a git project:
1. Modified : making some additions to the original project
2. Staged:  all the new files are finally ready to be joined to the remote repository. the staged files are ready to be committed
3. Committed: successfully applied a certain modification to the code.

Is it possible to do a git commit before git add? If No, explain why?
No, it is not possible to do a git commit before a git add.
We have to add files to the staging area and only then we can commit to make the changes permanent.

Why is git diff used?
Diff command is used in git to track the difference between the changes made on a file. Diff command takes two inputs and reflects the differences between them.

Can we leave the commit messages as blank?
Yes, we can leave the commit messages as blank by using the following command:
git commit-a —allow-empty-message-m “ “
